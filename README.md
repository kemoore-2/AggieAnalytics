Aggie Analytics will provide a web-based platform that turns game data into visual, actionable insights. 
Coaches and players will be able to interact with box score data graphs to see uncommon trends from previous games and performance metrics that can be used to make adjustments. Instead of manually analyzing box score data, we have streamlined the process so coaches can effectively game-plan for the upcoming season.

Our product will be used to assist the North Carolina A&T basketball coaches by reducing the time spent gathering insights from box score statistics. By using past season data, users will be able to view graphs that showcase high-value players, Offensive and Defensive metrics, and Opponent projections. 
This will be a tool that is intended to be used leading up to the basketball season, and in between each game.
